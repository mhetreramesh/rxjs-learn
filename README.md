**What is it?**: *An API for asynchronous programing with observable streams.*

1. **Streams**: Are values/events emitted over times 
2. **Observable**: An observable is a function that produces a stream of values to an observer over time. When you subscribe to an observable, you are an *Observer*. An observable can have multiple observers.
3. **Subscriptions**: Observers get converted to a *Subscriber*, in order to provide Subscription-like capabilities such as unsubscribe.
